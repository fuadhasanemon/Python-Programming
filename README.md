# Python-Programming

Playground to play football against Python. Exploring different aspects.

  - LinkedList(LL): Basic programming on LL. This includes how to insert data LL, get the middle of the LL, get length of LL etc. All the fucntions are properly named to be understood. 
  - SingleTon Thread(STT): Instead of using Celery, I have designed my own scheduler system using Singleton class and Thread. This works fine with any additional database coding to complete task using thread.
  - Mutil Proceessing Insertion: Bypassed the GIL in Python and used multiprocessing to insert millions of data in database. The code works astonishingly good with random data generation and insertion. Generate 20 processing units to insert 2 millions of data.
  - Socket: Basic socket programming in Python. Data can be recieved from differet IP even if it is not real IP.
  - Others: This repo also includes other programming problems solved in Python. Check the name of the Python files to understand the context.
